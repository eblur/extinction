Abstract:
    The chemical and physical properties of interstellar dust in the
    densest regions of the Galaxy are still not well understood. X-rays
    provide a powerful probe since they can penetrate gas and dust over a
    wide range of column densities (up to 10^24^cm^-2^). The interaction
    (scattering and absorption) with the medium imprints spectral
    signatures that reflect the individual atoms which constitute the gas,
    molecule, or solid.

    In this work we investigate the ability of high resolution X-ray
    spectroscopy to probe the properties of cosmic grains containing iron.
    Although iron is heavily depleted into interstellar dust, the nature
    of the Fe-bearing grains is still largely uncertain.

    In our analysis we use iron K-edge synchrotron data of minerals likely
    present in the ISM dust taken at the European Synchrotron Radiation
    Facility. We explore the prospects of determining the chemical
    composition and the size of astrophysical dust in the Galactic centre
    and in molecular clouds with future X-ray missions. The energy
    resolution and the effective area of the present X-ray telescopes are
    not sufficient to detect and study the Fe K-edge, even for bright
    X-ray sources.

    From the analysis of the extinction cross sections of our dust models
    implemented in the spectral fitting program SPEX, the Fe K-edge is
    promising for investigating both the chemistry and the size
    distribution of the interstellar dust. We find that the chemical
    composition regulates the X-ray absorption fine structures in the post
    edge region, whereas the scattering feature in the pre-edge is
    sensitive to the mean grain size. Finally, we note that the Fe K-edge
    is insensitive to other dust properties, such as the porosity and the
    geometry of the dust.

Description:
    We analysed a sample of six silicates and two iron sulfides.

    The two iron sulfides have different origins. The pyrrothite was
    synthesised in the laboratory at Astrophysikalisches Institut und
    Universitaets-Sternwarte (AIU), whereas the troilite has a meteoritic
    origin.

    The data presented in this paper (except metallic iron) were measured
    at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble,
    France.
